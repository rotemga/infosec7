When you unpickle an object, the __reduce__ method is called. The first argument to __reduce__ is a callable, that is, a function. The next argument is a tuple of arguments for __reduce__. In this case, when Exploit is unpickled, os.system is called, and is given 'echo hacked' as the argument.

Basically, by unpickling an object you don't know anything about, you're vulnerable to whatever the __reduce__ method does.
