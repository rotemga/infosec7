The q5.py program create file 'hack' that first is similar to example.json.
The program create thread that need to change 'command':'echo cool' to 'echo hacked'. The verify method in run.py running a lot of time (after the program got the command and signature from the file).
So, when the program is running, the thread can change the command to 'echo hacked' and execute_script function will run it.
